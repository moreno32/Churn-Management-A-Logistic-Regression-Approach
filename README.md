# Churn Management: A Logistic Regression Approach

## 🔄 Overview:
This project aims to develop a predictive model for customer churn in the telecommunications industry using logistic regression. The analysis is based on a hypothetical customer dataset where each record represents a single customer and contains various demographic and service usage information. The goal of this analysis is to identify which customers are most likely to leave the company, in order to reduce customer turnover and retain valuable customers.

## 🎊 Motivation:
Customer churn is a critical issue for many businesses, particularly those in the telecommunications industry. Retaining customers is often less expensive than acquiring new ones, so it is important to have a model that can accurately predict which customers are at risk of leaving. This project seeks to develop such a model and to provide insights that can be immediately applied to reduce customer churn.

## 🏁 Learning Objectives:
1)	Understanding the difference between linear and logistic regression
2)	Importing and pre-processing data using Python libraries
3)	Building a logistic regression model using scikit-learn
4)	Evaluating the performance of the model

## ⚙️ Technical Aspects:
The project uses logistic regression to predict customer churn. The dataset used is a hypothetical telecommunications customer dataset, Telco Churn. The analysis is performed using Python libraries including piplite, pandas, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, scikit-learn, scipy, and itertools.

## 🧰 Technology used:
The project is implemented using Python and its various libraries including piplite, pandas, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, scikit-learn, scipy, itertools, and pylab.

## 📚 Data Source:
The data source for this project is a hypothetical customer churn dataset, Telco Churn, which is publicly available. The data can be downloaded using the URL provided in the project description.

## 🗂️ Project Structure:
The project will consist of the following stages.
1)	Understanding the difference between linear and logistic regression
2)	Importing and pre-processing data using Python libraries
3)	Building a logistic regression model using scikit-learn
